# Prompt Log — Livermore (谋士)

## 2026-04-30

### Railway Setup
> "I am trying to set up railway for a project"
> "read the https://github.com/grepJimmyGu/the_counselor and lead me through the step by step set up"

Fetched repo structure. Identified: FastAPI backend (`apps/api`), Next.js frontend (`apps/web`), PostgreSQL, Alpha Vantage API. Repo already had `railway.json` configured.

### Domain Generation
> [screenshot: Generate Service Domain — port 8080]

Confirmed port 8080 is correct since `railway.json` uses `--port $PORT`.

### Healthcheck Failure (Attempt 1)
> [screenshot: Healthcheck failed after 5 retries]

Investigated. `/health` endpoint exists. Proposed fix: `env_parse_enlist="always"` in `SettingsConfigDict` to handle `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` JSON parse error.

> "Add `env_parse_enlist='always'` to the SettingsConfigDict..."

Applied fix and pushed.

### Healthcheck Failure (Attempt 2)
> "the railway deploy still fails, 1/1 replicas never became healthy!"

Reproduced crash locally. Discovered `env_parse_enlist` is not a real pydantic-settings option — it was silently ignored. Root cause confirmed: pydantic-settings v2 JSON-parses `list`-typed fields before field validators run. Widening annotation to `Union[str, list[str]]` bypasses JSON parsing and lets the existing field_validator handle the raw string.

> "commit and push"

Applied real fix and pushed.

### Backend Smoke Test
> "can I test if the backend works now"
> "thecounselor-production.up.railway.app"

Tested `/health` → `{"status": "ok"}`. Listed all routes via `/openapi.json`. Tested `/api/chat/strategy` — responded correctly.

### Frontend "Failed to fetch"
> "the front end deployed successfully but it shows up error 'Failed to fetch'"

Two issues found:
1. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Railway didn't include `https://the-counselor-web.vercel.app` → CORS blocked
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` not set in Vercel → frontend fell back to `http://127.0.0.1:8001`

### MVP Live
> "now I have my MVP up and running"

---

## 2026-05-01

### LLM Architecture Walkthrough
> "what's the difference, where does the LLM model plays a role?"

Explained the frontend/backend split and the 4 LLM integration points: chat→JSON parsing, markdown→JSON parsing, backtest explanation, sandbox review. Everything in between (the actual backtest) is deterministic.

### Merging LLM Branch
> "let's merge then walk me through the set up for LLM step by step"

Merged `LLM_chatbot` → `main`. Walked through Railway env var setup (`LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`). Confirmed LLM live by testing `/api/chat/strategy` and seeing structured clarification questions rather than fallback responses.

### Backtest "No price data" (NVDA)
> "when I run backtest the error pops up: No price data returned for NVDA"

Diagnosed: cache stale (Dec 2025 data, today May 2026), refresh failed on free Alpha Vantage tier, error unconditionally re-raised. Fixed `ensure_history` to fall back to cached data if it covers the requested range.

### Alpha Vantage Premium Key
> "I would like to replace my free API with a premium API for alpha vantage"
> "I have just swapped the key"

New error: PostgreSQL 65535 parameter limit hit on full history upsert. Chunked upsert to 1000 rows per batch. Verified NVDA backtest returns real metrics.

### LLM Always Returns `needs_clarification`
> "it seems this does not work 'Buy MSFT when MACD 5 day line is above MACD 26 day'"
> "the chatbot constantly returns The request lacks critical fields..."

Two fixes: (1) added indicator alias mapping (MACD→crossover, golden cross, RSI, etc.) to system prompt; (2) added default values for all optional fields so only universe+strategy_type trigger clarification.

### Ticker Validation + Index Mapping
> "how do we make sure all available stock index offered via alpha vantage API is actually being recognized"

Implemented: (1) index name→ETF ticker mapping in LLM prompt (S&P 500→SPY, Nasdaq→QQQ, Russell 2000→IWM, bonds→TLT, gold→GLD, etc.); (2) pre-backtest ticker validation against Alpha Vantage before running — returns clear error for unknown symbols.

### Default Date Range
> "the default time range should be set to latest data right?"
> "actually change to last 3 years" → "i think the problem is... end date should be default at latest date, and start date is 1 year"

Iterated to final: `end_date = today`, `start_date = today - 1 year`. Root cause of wrong dates: LLM used training cutoff (~Oct 2023) as "today". Fixed by injecting `Today: {date.today()}` into every chat parse prompt.

### Chinese/English i18n
> "I want to see if we can have a Chinese version for the entire website, including the LLM interaction, backtest results, and I can switch between Chinese / English version"
> "implement both"

Built full i18n: `i18n.ts` with ~120 strings for en/zh, `LocaleProvider` React context + `localStorage`, `LanguageSwitcher` toggle in header. All 5 components updated. Backend: `locale` field on all LLM requests; system prompt appends "Respond in Simplified Chinese" when `locale=zh`.

Fixed TypeScript build errors: `as const` made en/zh literal types incompatible → defined proper `Translations` interface with `string` fields.

### Rebrand
> "the name of website should be updated to Livermore, chinese name to '谋士'"

Updated in `i18n.ts` (both locales), `layout.tsx` metadata, and backend `config.py`.

### Git Author Fix
> "stop using jimmygu as the contributor for my commit!!"

Local repo config was overriding global. Ran `git config --unset user.name` to clear it; global `grepJimmyGu` now applies.

### A-Share Support
> "if I want to pull stock for shanghai stock index, can I do that"

Tested `600519.SHH` (Kweichow Moutai) — works. Shanghai uses `.SHH` suffix, Shenzhen uses `.SHZ`. Added: (1) auto-benchmark switch to `510300.SHH` (CSI 300 ETF) for A-share universes; (2) Chinese indicator keywords in LLM prompt; (3) Moutai demo prompt in both EN/ZH.

Fixed A-share volume overflow: `price_bars.volume` `INTEGER` → `BIGINT` via idempotent startup migration. Fixed benchmark: `000300.SHH` (raw index, not fetchable) → `510300.SHH` (ETF).

### MVP Optimization — Areas 1–4

> [Full optimization spec with 7 focus areas submitted]
> "let's start with 1-4 and treat 5-7 as follow up"
> "async" (for robustness engine)

Discussed scope, flagged robustness engine latency (sync vs async decision), pushed back on anti-overfitting memory (no auth → simplified to iteration_count passed from frontend). Agreed on implementation order 1→4.

#### Area 1 — Data Quality
- Extended `DataQualityService` with full quality checks: insufficient history (<30 rows), staleness (>7 days), adjusted_close coverage (<95% → blocked), volume coverage (<90% → warning), suspicious price jumps (>50% single-day), lookback window validation, benchmark-starts-later check
- New `DataQualityReport` and `BacktestQualityGate` schemas
- `GET /api/data/quality/{symbol}` endpoint added
- Backtest route now runs quality gate before every run: blocks on errors, attaches warnings to result

#### Area 2 — Backtest Credibility
- Buy-and-hold curve computed for primary ticker (single-asset strategies) and included in `BacktestResult`
- Extended `BacktestMetrics`: `profit_factor`, `avg_winner`, `avg_loser`, `median_trade_return`, `longest_winning_streak`, `longest_losing_streak`
- `BacktestResult.buy_and_hold_curve` added

#### Area 3 — Async Robustness Engine
- `RobustnessJob` DB model with status (pending/running/completed/failed)
- `RobustnessService` with 5 tests: parameter sensitivity, sub-period, transaction cost, benchmark comparison, peer ticker
- `POST /api/robustness/run` → 202 + `run_id` (FastAPI BackgroundTasks)
- `GET /api/robustness/{run_id}` → poll for results
- Auto summary generation highlighting concerns

#### Area 4 — Sandbox Reviewer v2
- Extended `SandboxReviewResponse`: `confidence_level`, `overfitting_risk` (enum low/medium/high), `data_quality_concerns`, `main_reasons_to_trust`, `main_reasons_to_distrust`, `required_next_tests`, `suggested_next_experiments`
- `iteration_count` added to `SandboxReviewRequest` — frontend passes this; LLM explicitly warns on high iteration counts (selection bias)
- System prompt rewritten: more skeptical, evidence-based, explicitly anti-promotional

#### Smoke test + frontend fixes
> "can we run a thorough smoke test to detect if there are any similar errors we need to fix?"

Schema audit revealed: `iteration_count` never sent to sandbox reviewer, `created_at` missing from `BacktestResult` type, old sandbox field names still in `research-workspace.tsx`. All fixed. Live endpoints verified: health, symbol search, data quality, backtest, explain, sandbox, robustness run+poll all returning correct fields.

#### Data quality UX fix
> "for error like this: Data quality check failed: No cached data found for MUA..."

Quality gate was blocking before any data fetch — confusing internal cache error exposed to users. Fixed: backtest route now auto-fetches uncached tickers before the quality gate runs. Gate only surfaces genuine data issues.

#### Data quality badge fix
> "Per-ticker quality badge + date range + first warning shown inline under ticker search in Strategy Preview, where I can see it"

Quality fetch only triggered on manual universe edit, not on LLM parse. Extracted `fetchQualityForSymbols` helper, called after every strategy parse.

## 2026-05-03 (continued) — Areas 6–8

### Areas 6-8 discussion
> "let's move to 6-8"
> "follow your recommendation for area 6-8, meanwhile, let's ensure we don't commit the mistakes we made before"

Agreed on: single "Run All" robustness button, pre-seeded strategy JSON for demos (not fake state), tests focused on metrics/data quality/robustness service.

#### Area 6 — Robustness Tab
- All robustness types added to `contracts.ts` matching backend schemas exactly
- `runRobustness()` and `getRobustnessJob()` added to `api.ts`
- i18n strings for all labels in EN and ZH
- Robustness tab: single "Run All" + optional peer tickers input
- Polls every 2s until completed/failed; shows up to 5 result tables (empty hidden)
- `VerdictBadge` color-coded: green=better/strong/robust, red=worse/weak/breaks_down

#### Area 7 — Demo Workflows
- 3 pre-seeded `StrategyJson` objects in `contracts.ts`: NVDA MA filter, QQQ RSI, mega-cap momentum rotation
- Demo picker section above Chat Builder — click loads strategy + logs to chat + triggers quality fetch
- Dates computed at runtime so they're always current

#### Area 8 — Tests
- `test_metrics.py`: extended with trade diagnostics + buy-and-hold coverage
- `test_data_quality.py`: 7 tests covering all check paths via mocked DB
- `test_robustness.py`: 6 tests verifying output shapes via mocked engine
- Fixed `Mapped[str | None]` → `Mapped[Optional[str]]` in `robustness_job.py` for Python 3.9
- 24/24 tests passing

## 2026-05-07 — Merge, Push & Bug Fixes

### Branch merge + push
> "merge the feature branch into main"
> "are these pushed to railway and vercel?"
> "before push it we need to confirm it's not going to crash and fix any potential bugs"

Pre-push checklist: 51/51 tests, frontend build, backend smoke test, Python 3.9 union type scan, routes audit, env var check. All passed. Pushed.

> "go ahead push"

Pushed to origin/main. Railway + Vercel auto-deployed.

### Commodity rotation end-to-end test
> "test the query 'Every month, rotate into the top 2 commodities by 3-month return from GLD, SLV, USO, UNG, DBA.'"

Parse result: strategy_type=momentum_rotation, benchmark=DBC (auto), rules=[] (bug — empty).

> "try running the backtest on it"

Hit 3 issues in sequence:
1. `Unknown or unsupported ticker(s): USO, UNG, DBA` — symbols not in local cache. Fixed by searching them through the API to populate cache.
2. `No price data returned` — local Alpha Vantage key is free tier, `TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED` is premium only.
3. `Array conditional must be same shape as self` — pandas shape mismatch in backtester engine on multi-asset strategies.

> "what was the reason it's not working before"

Explained: free-tier Alpha Vantage key in local `.env`.

> "update the local key: 4S0RU99V8RYCXQX0"

Updated `.env`. Restarted backend. Data fetched. Backtester crashed with shape mismatch.

**Bug 1 fix — empty momentum_rotation rules:**
LLM prompt missing instruction on what to put in rules[]. Added explicit example to system prompt + `_fix_momentum_rules()` post-processor.

**Bug 2 fix — multi-asset backtester crash:**
`pd.DataFrame.where(numpy[:, None])` doesn't broadcast on pandas multi-column DataFrames. Replaced with `weights.loc[non_rebalance_dates] = np.nan` — direct row assignment, no broadcasting.

Regression test added. Suite: 52/52. Both fixes pushed to main.

Final backtest result: 48.4% total return, Sharpe 1.29, vs DBC benchmark 50.9%.

## 2026-05-04 — Commodity Trading + QA Agent

### New feature branch
> "now I want to create a new feature under new branch, for same purpose but focusing on commodity trading"
> "go for it"

Created `feature/commodity-trading`. Discussed scope: commodity ETFs via Alpha Vantage (GLD, USO, etc.) reusing existing backtest stack — no futures/roll yield modeling. Agreed on auto-benchmark (DBC), commodity name→ETF mappings, and 3 demo strategies.

Implemented: `COMMODITY_TICKERS` set, `_is_commodity_universe()`, LLM prompt additions (commodity name→ETF + strategy type mappings), regex fallback updates, DBC auto-benchmark, commodity-specific notes in explanation/sandbox review, 3 `commodityDemoStrategies`, i18n updates EN+ZH. Fixed 4 pre-existing async/sync test failures. 44/44 tests passing.

### Testing the commodity feature
> "can I test the feature?"
> "double check it, I don't think it does any of the above you said"

Found `commodityDemoStrategies` was exported but never imported or rendered in `research-workspace.tsx`. Added import and a "Commodities" subsection in the demo picker alongside "Equities".

Backend was still running old code — killed old PIDs, restarted uvicorn. Also fixed `main.py` startup migration ordering bug (migrations ran before `create_all`, crashing on fresh SQLite DB).

Verified: `POST /api/chat/strategy` with GLD now returns `benchmark: "DBC"`.

### API key issue
> "Could not retrieve price data: GLD: No price data returned for GLD."

Local `.env` had free-tier Alpha Vantage key. `TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED` is premium-only. User needed to add premium key from Railway — same situation as 2026-05-01 NVDA issue.

### QA agent
> "let's build a QA agent following QA review request: [full template]"

Built `POST /api/qa/review` using existing LLM gateway + structured output. QA system prompt encodes the full review rules from the template (core flow first, backtest skepticism, confirmed vs hypothesis, evidence gaps). Frontend at `/qa` with form + structured report display (P0/P1/P2 issue cards, regression checklist, missing evidence).

> "I don't have anthropic API"

Replaced Anthropic SDK with `get_llm_gateway()` — same path as insights/strategy_parser. Removed `anthropic` from requirements.

> "try this openAI key: sk-proj-..."

Updated `apps/api/.env`. Key worked (no 401) but model returned prose-wrapped JSON on the complex QA schema. Fixed by adding `response_format: {type: json_object}` to all OpenAI requests in `llm_adapter.py` and embedding the explicit JSON schema in the QA system prompt.

QA agent returned first real report: P0 (DBC benchmark auto-selected without notifying user), P1 (suspicious GLD metrics hypothesis), P2 (no premium key disclaimer). Recommendation: **Hold**.

### Backtest credibility warnings
> "The Sharpe ratio should be within a reasonable range (typically < 2)."

Added `_credibility_warnings()` to `backtest.py` — checks Sharpe > 2, win rate > 80% (≥10 trades), total return > 100% on < 1 year window. Prepended to `result.warnings`. 8 new tests — 44/44 suite still passing.

### Trust and transparency feedback
> "1. Clear disclaimers... 2. All default settings clearly displayed... 3. AI explanation more thorough..."

Three changes:
1. Explanation LLM prompt rewritten to require thorough coverage: market regimes, specific risks, honest weaknesses, concrete next iterations, named disclaimer (data-snooping, execution assumptions)
2. Strategy Preview: yellow "Review before running" callout shows benchmark, date range, and costs before first backtest
3. Backtest tab: persistent disclaimer banner below results in EN + ZH
